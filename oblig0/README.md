# wordfreq
Simple command line program to list the frequency of words in a given input file.  

## Usage
`./<exec_path> <fpath> <min_wc> <min_wl> <lim_n_results>`

## Runtime Arguments
* `<fpath>`  
Path to a readable file. The file will never be modified.
* `<min_wc>`  
Exclude words that occur less times than this value. 1 to include all.
* `<min_wl>`  
Exclude words shorter than this value. 1 to include all.
* `<lim_n_results>`  
Print at most this many results. 0 to print all.

## Example Usage
* `./bin/debug/wordfreq.out src/wordfreq.c 10 2 10`  
    * Specify `src/wordsfreq.c` as the file to read by the program
    * Include only words from the file that occur 10 or more times
    * Include only words from the file that are 2 or more characters long
    * Limit to max 10 results
* `./bin/debug/wordfreq.out data/oxford_dict.txt 1 13 25`  
    * Specify `data/oxford_dict.txt` as the file to read by the program
    * Include words that occur at least once (all words)
    * Include only words from the file that are 13 or more characters long
    * Limit to max 25 results
* `sh run.sh`  
    * Runs either `bin/release` or `bin/debug`, whichever is available. 
    * Include words that occur at least once (all words)
    * Include only words from the file that are 1 or more characters long (all words)
    * Limit to max 20 results

## Other
The text file at `data/oxford_dict.txt` is a text file containing roughly 30000 entries from the oxford english dictionary, and may be utilized to test the program. Any files containing text are accepted, however, as demonstrated above where the program is given its own source file, `wordfreq.c`, as input.

The program will not work correctly unless the list implementation is working. An explicit check is performed to verify whether a call to `list_sort` actually sorted the list in question. If the program is in working order, the call `bin/debug data/oxford_dict.txt 100 4 10"` will result in the output below:

```log
--- oxford_dict.txt | Words consisting of at least 4 chars ---
Total number of words: 418737
Number of distinct words: 56333

--- Words that occured at least 100 times (limiting to max 10 results) ---

# Directory Structure
```
p1
  `--src
  `--include
  `--obj
  `--data
  `--?bin
     `--release
     `--debug
```

* `src/` - source files for the main program and dependancies
* `include/` - header files, specifying various interface/APIs
* `data/` - data files meant to be utilized by (or produced by) a program
* `obj/` - intermediary *object files* from the compilation. This allows make to only compile the files that have changed since the last compilation. Running `make distclean` will remove this folder.
* `bin/` - output directory for compiled executables. Running `make distclean` will remove this folder.


# Compiling the program
A makefile is provided to simplify compiling the program. The makefile provides two configurations for compiling the program, _debug_ and _release_.  

## _debug_
Compile with `make` or `make exec`.  
By default, the makefile is set to enable compile-time warnings and symbolic information nescessary for program such as gdb and lldb.
This mode is default for a reason. Unless you are certain the program works as intended, utilize this option.

## _release_
If `DEBUG=0` is set in the makefile, or overriden by `make DEBUG=0`, the program will instead be compiled with minimal warnings and a high degree of optimization.  
The compiled executable will be placed in `bin/release` and object dependencies will be placed in `obj/`. 

Build mode also directs the compiler to completely remove:
* All `printing.h` invocations except for `pr_error` and `PANIC`
* All assertions, either through `assert.h` or `printing.h`


# Running the program
Two options are available for running the program. They effectively result in identical calls.  
1. Compiling and running the program 'manually'.  
Example: `make && ./bin/debug/<execname> <args>`.
1. Utilizing `sh run.sh`

If runtime arguments are expected by the program, these are listed and explained if the program is run without any arguments.


# printing.h
Provides several printf-like macros that may be utilized:
```c
pr_error(fmt, ...)
pr_warn(fmt, ...)
pr_info(fmt, ...)
pr_debug(fmt, ...)
PANIC(fmt, ...)
assert(assertion)
assertf(assertion, fmt, ...)
```

The compile-time definition of `LOG_LEVEL` controls what prints are included in the compiled program:
```c
enum {
    LOG_LEVEL_PANIC = 0, /* minimum log level. only prints on PANIC. */
    LOG_LEVEL_ERROR,     /* enable pr_error */
    LOG_LEVEL_WARN,      /* enable pr_warn (+ pr_error) */
    LOG_LEVEL_INFO,      /* enable pr_info (+ pr_error, pr_warn) */
    LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG      /* enable pr_debug (+ pr_error, pr_warn, pr_info) */
};
```
If no compile-time definition of `LOG_LEVEL` is provided, it defaults to `LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG`.  

The following options are also available:
* remove colors (define `PRINTING_NCOLOR`)
* removal of meta information such as file/line. (define `PRINTING_NMETA`)

If you prefer utilizing typical `printf` calls, you are obviously free to do so. However, having the ability to toggle a category of prints by a single definition; rather than commenting them out, is quite convenient.
